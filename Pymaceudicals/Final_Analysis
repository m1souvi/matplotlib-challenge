Conclusions
The treatment results showed that Capomulin is the most effective treatment option.
1.	Survival Rate
  a.	About 85% of mice treated with Capomulin survived
  b.	Only 35% of mice treated with Infubinol survived
  c.	About 45% of mice treated with Ketapril and Placebo survived
2.	% Tumor Volume Change
  a.	Capomulin reduced tumor volume 19%
  b.	Treatment with Infubinol, Ketapril, and nothing (Placebo) were not significantly effective
    i.	Treatment with Infubinol (+46%) showed 5% more effective than Placebo (+51%)
    ii.	Treatment with Ketapril (+57%) actually was 6% worse than doing nothing and 11% worse than Infubinol
